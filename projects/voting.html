      <h1>Voting by mail is <span class="emphasized-text">frustrating.</span></h1>
      <p>For college students living away from home, absentee ballots are often the easiest way to vote. However, that doesn’t mean the process is easy. My team designed a service that would make voting by mail convenient by helping students through the ballot requesting process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-summary">
      <h1>In short:</h1>
      <p>We designed a <span class="emphasized-text">service</span> that would let students <span class="emphasized-text">print, sign and mail</span> their <span class="emphasized-text">absentee ballot requests</span> all at once at <span class="emphasized-text">club meetings.</span></p>

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>NU Votes is a program run by the Center for Civic Engagement at Northwestern University that aims to increase voter turnout among 		students. While 91% of eligible voters at 		Northwestern were registered as of 2016, only 64% of registered voters ultimately voted in the 2016 presidential election. Our task was to figure out how to increase those numbers.</p>
        <h1>My Role</h1>
        <p>I worked in a team of three. While we all contributed to the design process, I was in charge of the team's graphic design needs. Throughout the project, I created the deliverables using the content that the three of us created together. I worked in Illustrator and Photoshop to produce a series of posters documenting our steps in the process.</p>
        <h1>Timeline</h1>
        <p>My class was given the project prompt on Jan. 7. The first two weeks consisted of individual assignments before we were assigned teams on Jan. 21. We completed different steps of the design process each week until we presented our final deliverables on March 16.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-section">
        <h1>Our approach</h1>
        <p>Voting is a long process, so we decided to focus on one individual aspect rather than attempt to revamp the entire voting experience. Through our interviews with voters, we decided that the intital step of requesting absentee ballots was the most frustrating part of the process. Our service focused specifically on making that frustrating step convenient to encourage voters to see their vote through.</p>

        <h1>Brining the vote to students</h1>
        <p>Our initial solution was to have NU Votes ambassadors post in online groups for clubs they were a part of and offer assistance with printing and mailing their absentee ballot requests. We tested this in a team member’s sorority, but encountered our first major stumbling block: no one responded to our post. We solved this issue by making an in-person announcement at a sorority chapter 	meeting. Using our system, we were able to print and mail several ballot requests.</p>

      <h1>Final design</h1>

      <p>
        Our final service utilizes a portable kiosk  (think a laptop, printer and mailbox combined) that can be used to request, print and collect absentee ballot forms all at once. Our ambassadors can bring these kiosks to specific club meetings and help other members make their requests. This process is meant to make voters feel like they are being supported by a community rather than left to their own devices.
