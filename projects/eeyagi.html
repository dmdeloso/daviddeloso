      <p><em>Eeyagi</em> is a play produced as part of the Student Theatre Project Series at Northwestern University's Virginia Wadzworth Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts. Directed by Hannah Julie Yoon and produced by Jonyca Jiao, the show consists of modernized takes on traditional Korean folk tales. I was brought on as a graphic designer early in the process, and made all the promotional graphics and posters used for the play.</p>

      <h1>Initial Exploration</h1>

      <p>
      In January, Hannah asked me if I could make a quick graphic to promote auditions for her show, so I quickly designed a Facebook event cover. This show was devised, which means the cast creates the script as the rehearsal process goes on. In other words, there wasn't much for me to go off beyond the general idea of modernized Korean fairytales.

      <br>

      My main goal when designing was to emphasize the Hangul (Korean alphabet) rather than the Romanized script. After all, these stories were Korean at their core, not Western. To accomplish this, I made the Hangul the most prominent element in the design. Since this show focused on making the traditional modern, I tried to mix the two elements in the overall aethetic. I used simple paintbrush strokes to give the cover a more traditional feel, and clean, stroked text to give it a modern look.

      After the show was cast, I signed on to design the rest of the show's graphics. I decided to incorporate photos into the design to put the focus on the cast members. Early in the rehearsal process, I photographed each cast member. Since the script hadn't been finalized, none of the cast knew the characters they'd be playing, so I went with neutral poses.

      I updated the assets I used for the original poster for use in the final graphics. For the show's logo, I put the Romanized title inside the Hangul to emphasize the Korean alphabet once again. I chose to include the pictures on one side to add direction to the piece. Brushstrokes were once again used to add a traditional element to the otherwise modern design, this time on top of the pictures.
