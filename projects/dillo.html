      <h1>Dillo Day is a <span class="emphasized-text">big deal.</span></h1>
      <p>The event, held annualy at Northwestern, is the largest student-run music festival in the country, featuring a lineup of famous artists on the main stage. With so many acts 		performing, how can anyone keep track of them all? </p>

      <p>As entertainment editor for North by Northwestern, I helped answer that question with an interactive guide. I broke  down the info about each artist into digestible sections that readers could easily understand. The webpage is responsive, and converts to a single-column layout on mobile devices. All web development was done by me, and artist write-ups were 	contributed by various entertainment writers</p>

      <h1>In short:</h1>
      <p>I organized and developed an interactive guide to a student-run music festival.</p>

      <h1>Process</h1>

      <p>
        Work began at the end of April. My goal was to finish work on the interactive and design elements so that information about specific artists could be added in as they were revealed. I also announced the project to NBN’s entertainment section and had them sign up to write artist bios.
      </p>
      <div class="project-image-internal">

        <p>initial project spec (30 April 2019)</p>
      </div>
      <p>
      Since only one artist had been officially revealed when I began work on the project, I used placeholder images for most members of the lineup. I made bios expandable using JQuery, and included Spotify or YouTube links to songs by each artist.
      </p>

        <p>early version of the site featuring several placeholder images. (2 May 2019)</p>
      </div>
      <p>
      As artists were revealed, I assigned write-ups to various section contributors. I wrote the first artist bio myself, and created a format that would be fun and digestible for our audience. Since the styling had already been built, entering the text into the site was a straightforward process. Images were sourced from press releases provided by the festival’s marketing team.
